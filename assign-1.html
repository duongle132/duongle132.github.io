    <li> Butterick's Practical Typography</li>
    <li> Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think </li>

  <h2> Krug's definition of "thinking"</h2>
  <p> 
        Krug's definition of "thinking" is not to think anything at all. He wants the users to use the web easily just by what they physically see and what they have already know. <br><br>
The website should be straightforward to users. Krug emphasizes that the first law of usability is simplicity. The layout of the website should be clear for the user. It should have hierarchy, simple layout and appearance and clear information. It should be designed as if it is the instruction for user itself. Users "think" in a way that they know where they should look at first and how to use the website.<br><br>
From his examples, I think his suggestion is that designers should use common signs and common sense when they design. For instance, users are used to the act of clicking the button. The button is call to action. If they don't see the buttion, they will consider if the word is clickable. Therefore, designers should think and use what is common sense. They have to think like the users think and always come up with different situations and different problems

   <h2> Interacting with a website    	</h2>
    	<ul>
			 <p>When I interact with a website, I have a couple things in my mind:</p>
		<li>The design</li>
				I prefer a beautiful and clear design. I can easily see the concept, the color choice, and the font. It's even more attractive if the website is interactive with users and tell users what it is about, where to start.<br><br>
    I also like a website that is innovative. It can be the unique concept, innovative design, etc. You can see example <a href="http://www.digital-mosaic.co.uk/" title="here">here</a>.<br><br>
		<li>The information</li>
             	I prefer website that has clear information. I often close the tab if the website is too confusing. For example, it's too crowded with information. It has confusing and not coherent information. <br><br>
                Especially, I will continue to read if the website suggests me relating information about the topic that I care about. Or it shows everything that I want to know about without opening different tabs and searching on other pages like google or youtube.<br><br>
                One good example is <a href="http://www.emcosmetics.com/chiaroscuro-contour-and-highlighter-stick/3605970495831.html" title="this">this</a>. Em cosmetics' pages allow users to see all the information such as live preview, related items, reviews, etc. Users, thus, don't have to find information on other pages.
