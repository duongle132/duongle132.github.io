    <h3> <center> Krug's definition of "thinking" </center></h3>
        Krug's definition of "thinking" is not to think anything at all. He wants the users to use the web easily just by what they physically see and what they already know. <br><br>
The website should be straightforward to users. Krug emphasizes that the first law of usability is simplicity. The layout of the website should be clear for the user. It should have hierarchy, simple layout and appearance and clear information. It should be designed as if it is the instruction for user itself. Users "think" in a way that they know where they should look at first and how to use the website.<br><br>
From his examples, I think his suggestion is that designers should use common signs and common sense when they design. For instance, users are used to the act of clicking the button. The button is call to action. If they don't see the buttion, they will consider if the word is clickable. Therefore, designers should think and use what is common sense. They have to think like the users think and always come up with different situations and different problems
