  <h2> Krug's definition of "convention"</h2>
  <p> In website, convention is what we can easily recognize at first glance. It is what we have been using all the time. Convention is what people all agree of.<br><br>
  Convention is easy to find in the website. First, when you look at the website and see 2 colors red and white. You will assume that these are the colors of the company/organization. Second, when you look at the layout, you can see common signs like buttons, search bar, search box, navigation bar, etc. These are common instructive signs that you see everywhere, therefore, you can recognize it easily. <br><br>
  Maybe convention is rule that designers have to follow to make the website more clear to users. And to users, convention is instruction leading them how to use the website efficiently.
